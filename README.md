# Car-Failure-in-US-Dashboard-using-R
# Project Overview

This project involves creating a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes car failure trends and patterns across the United States. The dashboard provides insights into the causes of vehicle breakdowns, failure frequency, and other relevant metrics, helping users understand key factors affecting car reliability.

# Features

Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes interactive charts and graphs that allow users to explore various aspects of car failures, such as failure types, geographic distribution, and vehicle age.

Data Insights: Provides analysis on the most common causes of car failure, helping to identify patterns related to weather conditions, manufacturer recalls, and component durability.

Geographic Analysis: Includes a map visualization that shows car failure hotspots across different states, enabling regional comparison.

Filters and Drill-Downs: Users can filter data based on criteria such as car make, model, year, and failure type to gain a deeper understanding of specific trends.

# Technologies Used

Data Processing: R for data wrangling and manipulation.

Visualization: Built using R Shiny and libraries such as ggplot2 and plotly for creating interactive visualizations.

Dashboard Layout: The dashboard is structured with a user-friendly interface to navigate through different sections, including trends, maps, and summary statistics.
